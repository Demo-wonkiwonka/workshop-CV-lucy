## üé® Custom Dataset Creation

### Creating Synthetic Datasets

```python
from handwriting_workshop.dataset_creator import create_handwriting_dataset

# Create a synthetic dataset
creator = create_handwriting_dataset(
    output_dir="my_dataset",
    dataset_type="synthetic",
    character_set="mixed",  # or "uppercase_letters", "numbers", etc.
    num_samples_per_class=100,
    image_size=(32, 32)
)
```

### Creating from Real Images

```python
# Create from directory structure
creator = create_handwriting_dataset(
    output_dir="my_dataset",
    dataset_type="from_images",
    images_dir="path/to/images",
    labels_file="labels.csv"  # optional
)
```

### Generating Sample Sheets

```python
# Create a sample sheet for handwriting collection
creator.create_sample_sheet(
    output_path="handwriting_sample.png",
    characters=list("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789")
)
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Training Individual Models

```python
from handwriting_workshop.models import create_model
from handwriting_workshop.trainer import ModelTrainer

# Create a specific model
model = create_model("resnet18", num_classes=10)

# Train the model
trainer = ModelTrainer(model)
history = trainer.train(train_loader, val_loader, epochs=10)

# Evaluate the model
from handwriting_workshop.evaluator import ModelEvaluator
evaluator = ModelEvaluator(model)
results = evaluator.evaluate_dataset(test_loader)
```

### Comparing Multiple Models

```python
from handwriting_workshop.trainer import MultiModelTrainer

# Define model configurations
models_config = [
    {'name': 'simple_cnn', 'type': 'simple_cnn', 'num_classes': 10},
    {'name': 'resnet18', 'type': 'resnet18', 'num_classes': 10},
    {'name': 'vit', 'type': 'vit', 'num_classes': 10}
]

# Train all models
multi_trainer = MultiModelTrainer()
results = multi_trainer.train_multiple_models(
    models_config, train_loader, val_loader, test_loader
